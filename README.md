# Understanding the Notebooks

### Brute Force

To run a matrix through the Brute Force algorithm, download the "testing_code_with_manual_input" file. Upload the file to the [IBM Quantum Lab](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) and edit the third code box on line 6 and 11. Ensure n is equal to the number of nodes you are using and insert your matrix as (node1, node2, weight) as elist.

### QAOA

To run a matrix through the QAOA algorithm, download the "testing_code_with_manual_input" file. Upload the file to the [IBM Quantum Lab](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) and follow the steps above to set up the graph. Run the entire notebook.

### VQE

To run a matrix through the VQE algorithm, download the "vqe_test_template" file. Upload the file to the [IBM Quantum Lab](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) and edit the third code box on line 6 and 11. Ensure n is equal to the number of nodes you are using and insert your matrix as (node1, node2, weight) as elist.

### QRAO

To run a matrix through the QRAO algorithm, follow the installation steps found [here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/prototype-qrao/blob/main/INSTALL.md), but use THIS repository. Some of the parameters and utils have been changed and reflected in this code. Once your jupyter notebook is running, select the "QApplicationsQRAO" file, and run the entire notebook.

**We do not own the entire QRAO code. Much of it was sampled from an IBM Prototype.**
