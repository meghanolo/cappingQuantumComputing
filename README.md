# Understanding the Notebooks

To run a matrix through the Brute Force algorithm, download the "testing_code_with_manual_input" file. Upload the file to the (IBM Quantum Lab)[https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/] and edit the third code box on line 6 and 11. Ensure n is equal to the number of nodes you are using and insert your matrix as (node1, node2, weight) as elist.

To run a matrix through the QAOA algorithm, download the "testing_code_with_manual_input" file. Upload the file to the IBM Quantum Lab[https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/] and follow the steps above to set up the graph. Run the entire notebook.


**We do not own the entire QRAO code. Much of it was sampled from an IBM Prototype.**
